Given an array arr[] denoting heights of N towers and a positive integer K, you have to modify the height of each tower either by increasing or decreasing them by K only once. After modifying, height should be a non-negative integer. 
Find out what could be the possible minimum difference of the height of shortest and longest towers after you have modified each tower.

Example 1:

Input:
K = 2, N = 4
Arr[] = {1, 5, 8, 10}
Output: 5
Explanation: The array can be modified as 
{3, 3, 6, 8}. The difference between 
the largest and the smallest is 8-3 = 5.


class Solution{   
public:
    int getMinDiff(int arr[], int n, int k) {
        // code here
        sort(arr,arr+n);
        int bigg=0;int small=0;
        int result=arr[n-1]-arr[0];
        for(int i=1;i<=n-1;i++)
        {
            if(arr[i]-k>=0)
            {
                bigg=max(arr[i-1]+k,arr[n-1]-k);
                small=min(arr[0]+k,arr[i]-k);
                result=min(result,bigg-small);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
};
