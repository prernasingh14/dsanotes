Given two integer arrays A1[ ] and A2[ ] of size N and M respectively. Sort the first array A1[ ] such that all the relative positions of the elements in the first array are the same as the elements in the second array A2[ ].
See example for better understanding.
Note: If elements are repeated in the second array, consider their first occurance only.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 11 
M = 4
A1[] = {2, 1, 2, 5, 7, 1, 9, 3, 6, 8, 8}
A2[] = {2, 1, 8, 3}
Output: 
2 2 1 1 8 8 3 5 6 7 9
Explanation: Array elements of A1[] are
sorted according to A2[]. So 2 comes first
then 1 comes, then comes 8, then finally 3
comes, now we append remaining elements in
sorted order.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 11 
M = 4
A1[] = {2, 1, 2, 5, 7, 1, 9, 3, 6, 8, 8}
A2[] = {99, 22, 444, 56}
Output: 
1 1 2 2 3 5 6 7 8 8 9
Explanation: No A1[] elements are in A2[]
so we cannot sort A1[] according to A2[].
Hence we sort the elements in non-decreasing 
order.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function sortA1ByA2() which takes the array A1[ ], array A2[ ] and their respective size N and M as input parameters and returns the sorted array A1[ ] such that the relative positions of the elements in A1[ ] are same as the elements in A2[ ]. For the elements not present in A2[ ] but in A1[ ], it appends them at the last in increasing order. 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N * Log(N)).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).

Constraints:
1 ≤ N, M ≤ 106
1 ≤ A1[i], A2[i] ≤ 106



vector<int> sortA1ByA2(vector<int> arr1, int n, vector<int> arr2, int m) 
    {
        //Your code here
        map<int,int>mp;
        vector<int>answer;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
          mp[arr1[i]]++;//store freq of every element of arr1
        }
        //since we have sort according to appearance in arr2 , we begin from arr2
        //and as they come in arr2 , we see whether they are present in arr1 or not 
        for(int i=0;i<m;i++)
        {
           int num=arr2[i];
           while(mp[num]>0)//if in arr1 
           {
               answer.push_back(num);//put it in vector 
               mp[num]--;//decrease its count 
           }
        }
        for(auto i:mp)//now for rest of the elements which weren't present in arr1 but are in arr2
        {
            while(i.second>0)
            {
                answer.push_back(i.first);
                i.second--;
            }
        }
        return answer;
    } 
};


TC:O(n*logn)since putting in velues in map is O(logn ) due to bst approach in application 

SC:O(n)  due to map
