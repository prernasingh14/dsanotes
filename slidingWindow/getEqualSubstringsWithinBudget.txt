Leetcode 1208:
https://leetcode.com/problems/get-equal-substrings-within-budget/


You are given two strings s and t of the same length. You want to change s to t. Changing the i-th character of s to i-th character of t costs |s[i] - t[i]| that is, the absolute difference between the ASCII values of the characters.

You are also given an integer maxCost.

Return the maximum length of a substring of s that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of twith a cost less than or equal to maxCost.

If there is no substring from s that can be changed to its corresponding substring from t, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcd", t = "bcdf", maxCost = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: "abc" of s can change to "bcd". That costs 3, so the maximum length is 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "abcd", t = "cdef", maxCost = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: Each character in s costs 2 to change to charactor in t, so the maximum length is 1.
Example 3:

Input: s = "abcd", t = "acde", maxCost = 0
Output: 1
Explanation: You can't make any change, so the maximum length is 1.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length, t.length <= 10^5
0 <= maxCost <= 10^6
s and t only contain lower case English letters.

    //we need to change within the given cost 
    //you want to change s to t
    int equalSubstring(string s, string t, int maxCost) {
        int n1=s.size();
        int n2=t.size();
        int j=0;
        int cost=0;
        int maxLen=0;
        for(int i=0;i<n1;i++){
                if(i>=n2)
                break;
                cost+=abs(s[i]-t[i]);
            //now if we are exceeding our cost 
            if(cost>maxCost){
                cost-=abs(s[j]-t[j]);
                j++;
            }
            maxLen=max(maxLen,i-j+1);
        }
        return maxLen;
    }
