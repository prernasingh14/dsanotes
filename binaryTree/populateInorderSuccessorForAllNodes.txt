Given a Binary Tree, write a function to populate next pointer for all nodes. The next pointer for every node should be set to point to inorder successor.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains an integer n denoting the number of edges respectively. The last line contains the edges of the tree.

Output:
Print the data for both nodes separated by "->" ( without quotes). -1 is printed if there is no successor for the node.

Constraints:
1<=T<=10^5
1<=n<=10^5
1<=data of the node<=10^5

Example:
Input:
1
3
10 8 L 8 3 L 10 12 R

Output:
3->8 8->10 10->12 12->-1



we need to do inorder traversal and have a prev node to attach the current  node to it


void populateNext(struct node* root)
{

// Your code goes here
static struct node* prev=NULL;
if(root==NULL)
return ;
populateNext(root->left);
if(prev)
prev->next=root;
prev=root;
populateNext(root->right);


}
