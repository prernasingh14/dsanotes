Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

Example:

Given the sorted array: [-10,-3,0,5,9],

One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:

      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -10  5



recursive approach:
make the middle element as the root first and then recur for the left &  right subtree making the middle element of the left & right subarray 

class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* buildTree(vector<int>&nums,int low,int high)
    {
        if(low>high)
            return NULL;
         int mid=low+(high-low)/2;
        TreeNode* root=new TreeNode(nums[mid]);
        root->left=buildTree(nums,low,mid-1);
        root->right=buildTree(nums,mid+1,high);
        return root; 
    }
    TreeNode* sortedArrayToBST(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n=nums.size();
        if(n==0)
            return NULL;
      return buildTree(nums,0,n-1);
        
    }
};
