Given a binary tree and an integer S, check whether there is root to leaf path with its sum as S.

Example 1:

Input:
Tree = 
            1
          /   \
        2      3
S = 2

Output: 0

Explanation:
There is no root to leaf path with sum 2.
Example 2:

Input:
Tree = 
            1
          /   \
        2      3
S = 4

Output: 1

Explanation:
The sum of path from leaf node 3 to root 1 is 4.


recursive approach:



bool hasPathSum(Node *root, int S) {
    // Your code here
    if(root==NULL)
    {
    if(S==0)
    return true;
    else
    return false;
    }
    return hasPathSum(root->left,S-root->data)||hasPathSum(root->right,S-root->data);
    
}
