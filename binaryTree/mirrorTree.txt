Given a Binary Tree, convert it into its mirror.
MirrorTree1            

Example 1:

Input:
      1
    /  \
   2    3
Output: 2 1 3
Explanation: The tree is
   1    (mirror)  1
 /  \    =>      /  \
3    2          2    3
The inorder of mirror is 2 1 3
Example 2:

Input:
      10
     /  \
    20   30
   /  \
  40  60
Output: 30 10 60 20 40
Explanation: The tree is
      10               10
    /    \  (mirror) /    \
   20    30    =>   30    20
  /  \                   /   \
 40  60                 60   40
The inroder traversal of mirror is
30 10 60 20 40.
Your Task:
Just complete the function mirror() that takes node as paramter  and convert it into its mirror. The printing is done by the driver code only.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(Height of the Tree).

Constraints:
1 ≤ Number of nodes ≤ 105
1 ≤ Data of a node ≤ 105

for every node -> its left and right subtree are getting exchanged 

class Solution{
    public:
    //Function to convert a binary tree into its mirror tree.
    void mirror(Node* node)
    {
     // code here
     if(node==NULL)
     return ;
     Node* temp=node->left;
     node->left=node->right;
     node->right=temp;
     mirror(node->left);
     mirror(node->right);
    }
};
