Given an array arr[] and a number K where K is smaller than size of array, the task is to find the Kth smallest element in the given array. It is given that all array elements are distinct.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 6
arr[] = 7 10 4 3 20 15
K = 3
Output : 7
Explanation :
3rd smallest element in the given 
array is 7.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 5
arr[] = 7 10 4 20 15
K = 4
Output : 15
Explanation :
4th smallest element in the given 
array is 15.
Your Task:
You don't have to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function kthSmallest() which takes the array, it's size and an integer k as input and returns the kth smallest element.
 
 
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= arr[i] <= 105
1 <= K <= N


brute force:

sorting 

tc:o(nlogn)


efficient :
using max-heap-

int kthSmallest(int arr[], int l, int r, int k) {
    //code here
    priority_queue<int>pq;//smallest req thus make max heap taaki we can remove larger numbers 
    for(int i=l;i<=r;i++)//n
    {
        pq.push(arr[i]);
        if(pq.size()>k)//size of priority queue is always maintained as k 
        pq.pop();
    }
    return pq.top();
}
//thus TC:O(nlogk)






another way using min-heap:



int kthSmallest(int arr[], int l, int r, int k) {
    //code here
    priority_queue<int,vector<int>,greater<int>>pq;//smallest req thus make max heap taaki we can remove larger numbers 
    for(int i=l;i<=r;i++)//n
    {
        pq.push(arr[i]);
    }
    while(k>1)
    {
        pq.pop();
        k--;
    }
    return pq.top();
}
//thus TC:O(n+klogn)



best in O(n) time complexity:


some modification in quick sort needs to be done
