We have a collection of stones, each stone has a positive integer weight.

Each turn, we choose the two heaviest stones and smash them together.  Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y.  The result of this smash is:

If x == y, both stones are totally destroyed;
If x != y, the stone of weight x is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y-x.
At the end, there is at most 1 stone left.  Return the weight of this stone (or 0 if there are no stones left.)

Input: [2,7,4,1,8,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
We combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,4,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
we combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the value of last stone.
Method :
Put all elements into a priority queue.
Pop out the two biggest, push back the difference,
until there are no more two elements left.

class Solution {
public:
    //we can do this question using priority queue as everytime we have to take the heavist two stones and smash them
    int lastStoneWeight(vector<int>& stones) {
priority_queue<int> pq(begin(stones), end(stones));
        while (pq.size() > 1) {
            int x = pq.top(); pq.pop();
            int y = pq.top(); pq.pop();
            if (x > y) pq.push(x - y);
        }
        return pq.empty() ? 0 : pq.top();
    }
    };
