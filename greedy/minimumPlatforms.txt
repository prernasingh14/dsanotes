Given arrival and departure times of all trains that reach a railway station. 
Your task is to find the minimum number of platforms required for the railway station so that no train waits.
Note: Consider that all the trains arrive on the same day and leave on the same day. Also, arrival and departure times will not be same for a train, but we can have arrival time of one train equal to departure of the other.
In such cases, we need different platforms, i.e at any given instance of time, same platform can not be used for both departure of a train and arrival of another.

Input: N = 6 
arr[] = [0900  0940 0950  1100 1500 1800]
dep[] = [0910 1200 1120 1130 1900 2000]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
Minimum 3 platforms are required to 
safely arrive and depart all trains.



TC:O(nlogn) 

int findPlatform(int arr[], int dep[], int n)
{
	// Your code here
	sort(arr,arr+n);sort(dep,dep+n);
	int i=1;int j=0;int plat=1;int maxplat=0;
	///jis train ka sabse kam arrival time hai woh toh arrive karegi hi on the 
	//first platform
	while(i<n && j<n)
	{
	  if(arr[i]<=dep[j])/////if arrives until the train has departured then obviously we need extra platform 
	  {
	      plat++;i++;
	  }
	  else
	  {
	      plat--;j++;
	  }
	  maxplat=max(maxplat,plat);
	}
	return maxplat;
}
