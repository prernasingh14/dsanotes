Leetcode 188-


You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day, and an integer k.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most k transactions.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

 

Example 1:

Input: k = 2, prices = [2,4,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.
Example 2:

Input: k = 2, prices = [3,2,6,5,0,3]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4. Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
 

Constraints:

0 <= k <= 100
0 <= prices.length <= 1000
0 <= prices[i] <= 1000


this problem is similar to buy and sell stock 1 with a slight modification that transactions allowed are k instead of 1

Recursion with memoization:



class Solution {
public:
    int buystate(vector<int>&prices,int i,int steps,int buy,vector<vector<vector<int>>>&dp){
       if(i>=prices.size()|| steps==0){
           return 0;
       }
       if(dp[i][buy][steps]!=-1)
           return dp[i][buy][steps];
       if(buy){//if we can buy
           return dp[i][buy][steps]=max(-prices[i]+buystate(prices,i+1,steps,!buy,dp),buystate(prices,i+1,steps,buy,dp));
       }
       else
       {
           return dp[i][buy][steps]=max(prices[i]+buystate(prices,i,steps-1,!buy,dp),buystate(prices,i+1,steps,buy,dp));
       }
   }
    int maxProfit(int k, vector<int>& prices) {
         vector<vector<vector<int>>>dp(prices.size(),vector<vector<int>>(2,vector<int>(k+1,-1)));
        return buystate(prices,0,k,1,dp);
    }
};
