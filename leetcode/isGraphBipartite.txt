Given an undirected graph, return true if and only if it is bipartite.

Recall that a graph is bipartite if we can split its set of nodes into two independent subsets A and B, such that every edge in the graph has one node in A and another node in B.

The graph is given in the following form: graph[i] is a list of indexes j for which the edge between nodes i and j exists.  Each node is an integer between 0 and graph.length - 1.  There are no self edges or parallel edges: graph[i] does not contain i, and it doesn't contain any element twice.

 

Example 1:


Input: graph = [[1,3],[0,2],[1,3],[0,2]]
Output: true
Explanation: We can divide the vertices into two groups: {0, 2} and {1, 3}.
