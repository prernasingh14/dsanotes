1663. Smallest String With A Given Numeric Value



The numeric value of a lowercase character is defined as its position (1-indexed) in the alphabet, so the numeric value of a is 1, the numeric value of b is 2, the numeric value of c is 3, and so on.

The numeric value of a string consisting of lowercase characters is defined as the sum of its characters' numeric values. For example, the numeric value of the string "abe" is equal to 1 + 2 + 5 = 8.

You are given two integers n and k. Return the lexicographically smallest string with length equal to n and numeric value equal to k.

Note that a string x is lexicographically smaller than string y if x comes before y in dictionary order, that is, either x is a prefix of y, or if i is the first position such that x[i] != y[i], then x[i] comes before y[i] in alphabetic order.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 3, k = 27
Output: "aay"
Explanation: The numeric value of the string is 1 + 1 + 25 = 27, and it is the smallest string with such a value and length equal to 3.
Example 2:

Input: n = 5, k = 73
Output: "aaszz"


class Solution {
public:
    string getSmallestString(int n, int k) {
       //fill the string initially with 'a' as the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained is a 
        string ans(n,'a');
       //we need to fill it in optimal way 
        //we need to begin by assigning the highest characters starting from the end because //
        //then the smallest ones can come in the beginning 
        for(int i=n-1;i>=0;i--)
        {
            if(26+i<=k)
            {
                ans[i]='z';
                k=k-26;
            }
            else
            {
                ans[i]=('a'-1)+(k-i);//we need to consider the fact that we need to fill it in such a way that rest places should also be filled after that 
            //we can't allocate some character equal to the remaining sum because then it might be possible filling rest places might exceed the sum 
                k=k-(k-i);//remaining sum
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
