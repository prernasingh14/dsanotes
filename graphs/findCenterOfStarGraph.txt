There is an undirected star graph consisting of n nodes labeled from 1 to n. A star graph is a graph where there is one center node and exactly n - 1 edges that connect the center node with every other node.

You are given a 2D integer array edges where each edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates that there is an edge between the nodes ui and vi. Return the center of the given star graph.

 

Example 1:


Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[4,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: As shown in the figure above, node 2 is connected to every other node, so 2 is the center.
Example 2:

Input: edges = [[1,2],[5,1],[1,3],[1,4]]
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

3 <= n <= 105
edges.length == n - 1
edges[i].length == 2
1 <= ui, vi <= n
ui != vi
The given edges represent a valid star graph.


//any node having edges out from it =n-1 will be center of the graph 


class Solution {
public:
    int findCenter(vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        int n=0;
        for(int i=0;i<edges.size();i++){
            n=max(n,max(edges[i][0],edges[i][1]));
        }
        vector<int>indegree(n+1,0);
        for(int i=0;i<edges.size();i++){
            indegree[edges[i][1]]++;
            indegree[edges[i][0]]++;
        }
        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)
        {
            if(indegree[i]==n-1){
                return i;
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
};
